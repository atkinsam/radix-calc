# alfred-rust-calc

**This totally needs a better name and a shorter binary abbreviation (`rc`?
`rcalc`?  Both are already taken...).**

This is a simple programmer's calculator written in Rust.  It can be used
directly on the command line as an alternative to `printf "0x%x\n" $(( ... ))`
shell expressions, though it's main purpose is to support an
[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow.

## Examples

```
$ alfred-rust-calc 5+5
10

... # more here please
```
